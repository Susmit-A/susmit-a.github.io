          <p class="section-content">
            I'm interested in building systems that take inspiration from natural intelligence, solving problems such as continual learning,
            composition-based learning, or consolidation of multimodal input streams - all of which the human brain solves effortlessly. I am 
            also interested in the various aspects of memory - its relation to neural architectures, its ability to link disparate knowledge 
            sources, its emergance in large pre-trained models, and its importance in enabling rapid learning of different tasks or cross-task 
            knowledge transfer. A more detailed version can be found <a href="research_statement.html">here</a>.

          <h3 class="section-heading">About Me</h3>
          <p class="section-content">
            I am a 3-year M.Tech. (RA) student at the Indian Institute of Technology - Hyderabad, advised by 
            <a href="https://people.iith.ac.in/vineethnb/">Prof. Vineeth N. Balasubramanian</a>. My current research 
            interests include neuro-inspired AI, learning from multimodal data, and explainable neural architectures. 
            I am also collaborating with <a href="https://chirag-agarwall.github.io/">Prof. Chirag Agarwal</a> at the
             University of Virginia. My core thesis is based on adapting pre-trained models for downstream tasks - using 
             such models for concept-based explanations, applying them in continual learning settings, and analyzing 
             fine-tuning methods. I am also interested in <a href="https://behavior-in-the-wild.github.io/">understanding and modelling human behavior</a>, where I aim 
             to create systems that can understand user requirements and adapt their outputs accordingly.
          </p>
          <p class="section-content">
            I have previously worked with <a href="https://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/venky/">Prof. R. Venkatesh Babu</a> at 
            the Indian Institute of Science on multiple domains in Computer Vision and Computational Photography - particularly 
            High Dynamic Range Imaging and Representation Learning. I briefly worked at Qualcomm R&D on no-reference image 
            quality analysis, image super-resolution and image-to-image translation under hardware constraints. I have also 
            interned with the Adobe Media Data Science and Research (MDSR) Team, where I collaborated with 
            <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n8iUBg8AAAAJ&hl=en">Balaji Krishnamurthy</a> and 
            <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/yaman-kumar/">Yaman Kumar</a> on aligning LLMs to human opinions.
